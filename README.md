# Jazzboard

A way to play jazz lead sheets on a computer keyboard. Prototype web interface 
made at the outernet by [@hackclub](https://github.com/hackclub)!

## Disclaimer
This isn't a legitimate instrument, and my music theory is very limited.
For some background, I am a mediocre violin player who learned classical music, 
and I tried to learn to play jazz on the piano, but I am terrible at it.

## Dev Notes

- `/original-sounds`are ff piano files from https://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html
  - lol git ignored because it is too large
- `/edited-sounds` are just renamed so far and changed to wav files
- coverting from aiff to wav: https://superuser.com/questions/687934/batch-converting-aiff-to-wav
- renaming files lol: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rename-multiple-files-using-python
- used python to edit the sound files quickly
- converted all wav to mp3 so it loads more easily on web
