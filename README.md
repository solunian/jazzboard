# Jazzboard

A way to play some jazz standards on a computer keyboard.

## Disclaimer
This isn't a legitimate instrument, and my music theory is very limited.
For some background, I am a mediocre violin player who learned classical music, 
and I tried to learn to play jazz on the piano, but I am terrible at it.

## Dev Notes

- `/original-sounds`are ff piano files from https://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html
  - lol git ignored because it is too large
- `/edited-sounds` are just renamed so far and changed to wav files
